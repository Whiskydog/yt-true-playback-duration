# YT True Duration

This Chrome extension displays the duration of a YouTube video based on its playback rate next to its duration on the video controls.

That is, if a video is 10:00 long and you select 2x "playback speed" on YouTube, a label with (05:00) will appear in the controls next to the duration.

This lets you know exactly how much time you'd save by watching a video with an increased playback speed (and how much you'd loose watching it on a slower rate).

## Usage

Due to Google charging an upfront fee of 5 USD to publish to the Chrome Web Store and me being a broke student, this extension must currently be loaded unpacked:

1. Clone this repo locally.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` and enable "Developer mode" (top right).
3. Press the "Load unpacked".
4. Select the directory where the clone is and press "Select folder".

Now refresh YouTube. You can check the console for the `YT True Duration loaded!` log.
