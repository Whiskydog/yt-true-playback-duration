# YT True Duration

This extension displays the duration of a YouTube video based on its playback rate next to its duration on the video controls.

That is, if a video is 10:00 long and you select 2x "playback speed" on YouTube, a label with (05:00) will appear in the controls next to the duration.

This lets you know exactly how much time you'd save by watching a video with an increased playback speed (and how much you'd loose watching it on a slower rate).
